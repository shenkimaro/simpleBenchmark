# simplePerformance
A simple languages benchmark test.

What can you do to run these tests? 
First of all you need to install and configure the environment, so you need to be able to run:
- Python;
- PHP;
- GO language;
- C++;
- Javascript (Node);
- Java;

After this, just run the file and see how much time it costs for each language.
